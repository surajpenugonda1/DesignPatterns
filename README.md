# Java Design Patterns

This repository contains examples of common design patterns implemented in Java. Each pattern is demonstrated with practical, real-world examples to help understand their usage and benefits.

## Patterns Included

### Creational Patterns
- **Singleton Pattern**
  - Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it
- **Factory Method Pattern**
  - Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic
- **Abstract Factory Pattern**
  - Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes
- **Builder Pattern**
  - Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation
- **Prototype Pattern**
  - Creates new objects by cloning an existing object, known as the prototype

### Structural Patterns
- **Adapter Pattern**
  - Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an object in an adapter
- **Bridge Pattern**
  - Separates an abstraction from its implementation
- **Composite Pattern**
  - Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies
- **Decorator Pattern**
  - Adds new behaviors to objects dynamically by placing them inside wrapper objects
- **Facade Pattern**
  - Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem
- **Flyweight Pattern**
  - Reduces memory usage by sharing as much as possible with related objects
- **Proxy Pattern**
  - Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**
  - Passes requests along a chain of handlers
- **Command Pattern**
  - Turns a request into a stand-alone object containing all information about the request
- **Iterator Pattern**
  - Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially
- **Mediator Pattern**
  - Reduces coupling between objects by making them communicate via a mediator object
- **Observer Pattern**
  - Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects
- **Strategy Pattern**
  - Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable
- **Template Method Pattern**
  - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, letting subclasses override specific steps
